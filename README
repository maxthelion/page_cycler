# Page Cycler

This app allows you to cycle through a series of URLs in a single browser window. It is designed to be shown fullscreen on a monitor and to act as an aggregated information radiator of data you collect in multiple sources.

# Philosophy

Its overarching philosophy is to know as little as possible about your sources of data, and simple display the URLs you specify. How the data in the various sources is displayed is up to them.

Many dashboards aggregate raw data via APIs, and then display the data in a common format. While this can lead to very pretty results, the introduction of new sources of data can be complex, and often requires grappling with different authentication mechanisms etc.

## Other aims

* Super-lightweight slide mechanism that can be easily fiddled with
* No business-specific or authentication code
* No backend component, all config is in localStorage
* Allow the statics assets to be hosted anywhere, eg on Github Pages
